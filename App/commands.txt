# PMO App - Commands Reference

## Commands to Get PMO App Running

### 1. Update Browserslist Database
npx browserslist@latest --update-db
# This resolved the "browsers data is 6 months old" warning

### 2. Clean npm Cache
npm cache clean --force
# Cleared any cached files that might cause issues

### 3. Remove node_modules and Reinstall Dependencies
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm install
# Fresh installation of all dependencies

### 4. Build the Production Version
npm run build
# Created an optimized production build of your React app

### 5. Install Serve Package Globally
npm install -g serve
# Installed the static file server to serve the built app

### 6. Serve the Production Build
serve -s build
# Started serving the app at http://localhost:3000

## Quick Reference for Future Use

### To Start Your PMO App (Production Mode):
cd "D:\PMO\App"
npm run build
serve -s build

### To Update and Restart After Code Changes:
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run build
serve -s build

### If You Want to Try Development Mode Again:
npm start
# (Though this was hanging due to React 19 compatibility issues)

## Notes:
- The production build approach bypassed the development server hanging issue
- Your app loads at http://localhost:3000 when using `serve -s build`
- The build process showed some warnings but completed successfully
- Bundle size is larger than recommended - consider code splitting for optimization

## Alternative Development Server (if needed):
# If npm start continues to hang, you can also try:
$env:GENERATE_SOURCEMAP="false"; npm start

## Troubleshooting Commands:
# Check if port 3000 is in use:
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill node processes if needed:
taskkill /f /im node.exe

# Check for running node processes:
Get-Process -Name "node" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
